- **Responsive SVG Canvas**: The map automatically scales to fit your screen or container

## Technologies Used

- **React 19**: Modern React with hooks
- **D3.js**: Data visualization and SVG manipulation
- **d3-voronoi**: Voronoi diagram generation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fantasy-world-generator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
# If you are in the project root, first run:
# cd fantasy-world-generator
# then:
# npm start
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How to Use

### Basic Controls

- **New Map**: Generates a new world with the current Blob Count (see settings)
- **Random Map**: Creates a world with a higher Blob Count (11 blobs)
- **Reset Zoom**: Returns the view to the original position and scale

### Interactive Features

- **Click to Add Land**: 
  - First click creates an island
  - Subsequent clicks add hills
- **Mouse Hover**: Shows debug information about the cell under the cursor
- **Zoom and Pan**: Use mouse wheel to zoom, drag to pan

### Generation Parameters

#### Core Parameters:
- **Points Radius**: Controls the density of the Voronoi cells (1-10)
- **Max Height**: Maximum elevation for the primary land mass (0.1-1.0)
- **Blob Radius**: How quickly height spreads and decays (0.5-0.999)
- **Blob Sharpness**: Controls terrain randomness (0 = smooth, higher = jagged)
- **Blob Count**: Number of blobs/islands to generate (1-20, adjustable slider)
- **Sea Level**: Minimum water height; guarantees a water border around all land (default 0.2)

#### Visual Parameters:
- **Blur**: Adds a blurred outline effect to land masses (0-2px)
- **Show Grid**: Toggles the display of cell boundaries
- **Draw Sea Polygons**: Shows all polygons including ocean areas

#### Algorithm Behavior:
- **Main Peak**: First blob uses full max height value
- **Radius Decay**: Subsequent blobs decay by radius^b for natural progression
- **Height Accumulation**: Multiple overlapping blobs add their heights together
- **Sharpness Factor**: Randomness multiplier (0 = deterministic, higher = more variation)

## Algorithm Details

### Poisson-Disc Sampling
Creates a uniform distribution of points across the map area, ensuring no two points are too close together. This creates natural-looking, organic terrain patterns.

### Voronoi Diagram
Divides the map into cells based on the sampled points, where each cell contains all points closest to one of the sample points. This creates the basic terrain structure.

### Height Map Generation
Uses a **BFS-based blob algorithm** that efficiently generates organic terrain:

#### Algorithm Features:
- **Breadth-First Search**: Ensures proper height propagation from center points
- **Configurable Parameters**: Main peak, radius, sharpness, blob count, and sea level
- **Height Accumulation**: Multiple blobs can overlap and accumulate height
- **Natural Decay**: Subsequent blobs decay by radius^b for realistic progression
- **Randomness Control**: Sharpness parameter controls terrain variation
- **Guaranteed Water Border**: Blobs are seeded far enough from the edge to ensure land always falls below sea level before reaching the map border
- **Mountain-Range Clustering**: Secondary blobs cluster along existing ridges for natural mountain chains

#### Algorithm Process:
1. **Reset**: Clear all heights and temporary flags
2. **Blob Generation**: For each blob:
   - Select random starting point
   - Calculate initial height (main peak for first blob, decayed for others)
   - Initialize BFS queue with starting point
   - Spread height to neighbors with radius and sharpness factors
   - Continue until height drops below threshold
   - Blobs are seeded at least clearanceDistance from the edge (guaranteed water border)
   - Secondary blobs cluster along existing ridges for mountain-range shapes
3. **Height Capping**: Ensure heights don't exceed 1.0 maximum
4. **Cleanup**: Clear temporary flags for next generation

This approach generates more natural-looking terrain with better performance than the previous ad-hoc method.

### Feature Detection
Automatically identifies:
- **Oceans**: Large connected areas of low elevation
- **Islands**: Connected areas of high elevation surrounded by ocean
- **Lakes**: Connected areas of low elevation surrounded by land

### Coastline Generation
Detects edges between land and water cells, then connects them into continuous coastline paths using curve interpolation.
