# Fantasy World Generator Devlog

## Project Start
- **Goal:** Port a JSFiddle procedural world generator to a modern React + D3 app.
- **Initial Steps:**
  - Set up React 19 project structure.
  - Migrated core logic for Poisson-disc sampling, Voronoi diagrams, and heightmap generation.

## Major Milestones

### 1. Heightmap Generation
- Implemented BFS-based blob algorithm for organic terrain.
- Parameterized main peak, radius, sharpness, and blob count.
- Added robust feature detection (oceans, islands, lakes).

### 2. Coastline & Feature Rendering
- Automatic coastline detection and SVG path generation.
- Color-coded elevation and feature overlays.

### 3. UI & Controls
- Added sliders and toggles for all key parameters.
- Implemented zoom/pan with D3.
- Responsive SVG canvas for fluid resizing.

### 4. Robustness & Error Handling
- Added margin-based blob seeding to guarantee a water border.
- Bounded Poisson-disc sampler with max attempt limit to prevent infinite loops.
- User-facing warnings for restrictive settings.
- Fixed manifest.json syntax error.

### 5. Documentation & Code Quality
- Comprehensive README with algorithm details, troubleshooting, and usage.
- Cleaned up legacy code and removed unused logic.
- Added devlog to track project evolution.

## Key Bug Fixes
- Fixed d3-voronoi import and polygon path errors.
- Ensured coastlines and islands always render above ocean.
- Prevented app freeze on restrictive settings.
- Fixed SVG height attribute for standards compliance.

## Design Choices
- All map logic uses constants for mapWidth/mapHeight.
- Responsive design for modern UX.
- All settings exposed in UI for experimentation.
- Code structured for extensibility and clarity.

## Next Steps
- Add more terrain features (rivers, biomes).
- Export map as image or data.
- Further optimize performance for large maps.
